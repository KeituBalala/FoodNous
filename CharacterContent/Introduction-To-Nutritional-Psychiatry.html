    <h1>Everything You Need To Know About Nutritional Psychiatry</h1>
    
    <time datetime=" 2020/05/20"> Posted Sunday, 30 May</time>

     <p>Have you ever realised how much happier you are after enjoying a nice cold tub of ice cream, after a long and tedious day? 
         Or when you can't sleep at night and the first thing you think of is going to the fridge? Better yet, when you find yourself 
         stuck in a boring situation and your mind wanders off to what you’ll be eating for lunch or dinner. </p>

    <p>In my first blog post on my website, I want to introduce you to the concept of nutritional psychiatry. 
        Food is a large part of our daily lives. We need it to survive. Food is known to play a vital part in helping to promote 
        overall health and disease prevention.  Apart from tasting good, food consists of many necessary nutrients, such as proteins, 
        fats, minerals, carbohydrates, and vitamins.</p> 

    <p>A study by the <site> International Journal of Obesity</site>, in 2005, found that there was a relationship between obesity, 
        depression, and dietary factors. Furthermore, an article published in the Harvard Health blog titled <cite>Food and Mood-Is 
            there a connection?</site> advances that certain dietary choices and patterns may protect our mental health. 
            These articles were part of the many that began to contribute towards further study of the impact of food on psychological 
            performance.</p>

    <p>So what exactly is nutritional psychiatry?</p>
 
    <p>Nutritional Psychiatry is a rapidly growing technique whereby food is used in the treatment of mental health conditions. 
        Through my experiences in mental health issues and my qualifications in psychology, I use my blog to further explore this 
        concept of nutritional psychiatry by providing you with all the foods and ingredients that can help you have a healthy 
        functioning mind. </p>
