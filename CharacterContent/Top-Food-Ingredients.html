        <h1>Top Food Ingredients</h1>
        
        <p>In this blog post I wanted to share with you some of the top ingredients and snacks for a healthy mind. 
            These ingredients were suggested and written in collaboration with Medical Health Today. 
            I have summarised the top 6 most common of the ingredients, however you can get the full list in the reference like below. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Dark Chocolate</h2>
        <p><cite>Dark chocolate contains cocoa, also known as cacao. Cacao contains flavonoids, a type of antioxidant. 
            Antioxidants are especially important for brain health, as the brain is highly susceptible to oxidative stress, which contributes to age-related cognitive decline and brain diseases.
            Cacao flavonoids seem to be good for the brain. According to a 2013 review, they may encourage neuron and blood vessel growth in parts of the brain involved in memory and learning. They may also stimulate blood flow in the brain. 
            Researchers concluded that eating this type of dark chocolate may improve brain plasticity, which is crucial for learning, and may also provide other brain-related benefits.</cite> (Medical News Today, 2020)</p>

        <h2>Berries</h2>
        <p><cite> Similar to dark chocolate, many berries contain flavonoid antioxidants. Research suggests that these may make the berries good food for the brain. 
            Antioxidants help by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. A 2014 review notes that the antioxidant compounds in berries have many positive effects on the brain, including: 
            improving communication between brain cells reducing inflammation throughout the body increasing plasticity, 
            which helps brain cells form new connections, boosting learning and memory reducing or delaying age-related neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. 
            Antioxidant-rich berries that can boot brain health include: strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, blackcurrants, mulberries</cite>(Medical News Today, 2020)</p>

        <h2>Peanuts (Nuts and Seeds)</h2>
        <p><cite>Eating more nuts and seeds may be good for the brain, as these foods contain omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. 
            A 2014 study found that a higher overall nut intake was linked to better brain function in older age. 
            Nuts and seeds are also rich sources of the antioxidant vitamin E, which protects cells from oxidative stress caused by free radicals. 
            As a person ages, their brain may be exposed to this form of oxidative stress, and vitamin E may therefore support brain health in older age. 
            A 2014 review found that vitamin E may also contribute to improved cognition and reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease. 
            The nuts and seeds with the highest amounts of vitamin E include: sunflower, seeds, almonds, hazelnuts</cite>(Medical News Today, 2020)</p>

        <h2>Broccoli</h2>
        <p><cite>As well as being a low-calorie source of dietary fiber, broccoli may be good for the brain. 
            Broccoli is rich in compounds called glucosinolates. When the body breaks these down, they produce isothiocyanates. 
            Isothiocyanates may reduce oxidative stress and lower the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. 
            Broccoli also contains vitamin C and flavonoids, and these antioxidants can further boost a person’s brain health.</cite>(Medical News Today, 2020)</p>

        <h2>Eggs</h2>
        <p><cite>Enjoyed by many for breakfast, eggs can be an effective brain food. 
            They are a good source of the following B vitamins: vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, folic acid</cite>(Medical News Today, 2020)</p>

        <h2>Avocados</h2>
        <p><cite>A source of healthful unsaturated fat, avocados may support the brain. 
            Eating monounsaturated fats may reduce blood pressure, and high blood pressure is linked with cognitive decline. 
            Thus, by reducing high blood pressure, the unsaturated fats in avocados may lower the risk of cognitive decline. 
            Other sources of healthful unsaturated fats include: almonds, cashews, and peanuts, flaxseed and chia seeds, soybean, 
            sunflower, and canola oils, walnuts and Brazil nuts and fish.</cite>(Medical News Today, 2020)</p>
