        <h1>Easy Lockdown Recipes</h1>
        
        <p>During this lockdown I realised how comforting it is to cook and bake. It helps keep you from losing yourself in the 
            anxiety caused by the coronavirus pandemic, I like to believe that I’m not alone in this. Many local retails have 
            seen an increase in demand of baking supplies and ingredients.  I guess everyone is trying to keep their mind of a 
            few things, or it could be that everyone is finally home long enough to try recipes they’ve always wanted to create. </p>
        
        <p>I know a lot of people might disagree but I look forward to us not having access to junk food for some time. 
            It gives us an opportunity to really pay attention to what we put into our bodies. Below I compiled a short list 
            of easy to try recipes, for the lockdown. Two varities of dishes for each part of the day.  Give them a try and 
            tell me what you think. </p>
        
        <h2>Breakfast</h2>
        <h3> Pancakes for Breakfast </h3>
        <p>2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 
            1 1/2 cups milk, 2 large eggs, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for cooking, Powdered sugar or maple syrup, for serving</p>
        
        <p>Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Place 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 
            2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.</p>
       
        <p>Add the wet ingredients. Add 1 1/2 cups milk, 2 large eggs, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Whisk until almost smooth, 
            a few small lumps are fine.</p>
        
        <p>Let the batter rest while you heat a pan. Set the batter aside for 10 minutes. 
            Meanwhile, heat a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.</p>
        
        <p>Fry 3 pancakes for 3 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to the pan and swirl to coat. 
            Add 2-tablespoon portions of the batter to the pan, cooking 3 at a time. Cook on the first side until bubbles 
            appear on the surface, the edges begin to look dry, and the bottoms are golden-brown, about 3 minutes.</p>
        
        <p>Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pancakes. Cook until the second sides are golden-brown, 
            2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a warm oven or plate. Repeat using more oil and cooking the remaining batter.</p>
        
        <h2>Lunch</h2>
        <h3> Homemade burger </h3>
        <p>½ tbsp olive oil, 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped, 1 x 500g pack British, Beef Steak Mince 15% fat, 1 tsp mixed dried herbs, 
            1 egg, beaten, 4 slices mature Cheddar (optional), 4 white rolls, few round lettuce leaves, torn, 1 beef tomato, sliced, ketchup, to serve (optional)</p> 
        
        <p>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.</p>
        
        <p>In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands, 
            shape into 4 patties. Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 5-6 minutes on each side.</p>
        
        <p>While the second side is cooking, lay a slice of cheese on top to melt slightly (if using). 
            Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the barbecue. Fill with the lettuce, burgers and tomato slices. 
            Serve with ketchup, if you like. </p>
        
        <h2>Dinner</h2>
        <h3>Spaghetti and mince</h3>
        <p>Spaghetti, Olive oil (or ordinary cooking oil), 1 Onion (diced), 500g of Ground beef mince, 2 Potatoes cut into cubes, 
            2 Tomatoes (chopped), Your choice of spices, 1 cube of Beef stock, Your choice of soup.</p>
        
        <p>In one pot pour 400ml of water and bring to bowl, place spaghetti inside and let cook until soft, then drain. 
            In another pot pour 500ml of water and bring to a boil. Place 500g of ground beef into boiling water 
            (Be sure to separate beef into smaller portions).</p>
        
        <p>Once beef begins to brown, add diced onions and potatoes into the pot. Let simmer until potatoes soften, 
            then add spices, crushed beef stock and chopped tomatoes. Once mince mixture thickens add soup 
            (My suggestion is to add Royco chakalaka soup which provides great flavour).</p>
