                <p>
                    Andile Thomas Nkosi is a 25-year-old registered clinical psychologist fuelled by his passion for understanding 
                    the nuances of mental health, especially in the digital age. He considers himself a ‘forever student,’ eager to
                     both build on his academic foundations in psychology and sociology and stay in tune with the latest digital 
                     technologies through continued coursework and professional development. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    He is currently residing in Marshalltown, Johannesburg in a 2 bedroom apartment. He is empathetic and smart, 
                    however, he tends to be hypersensitive. Something interesting about Andile is that he is a reincarnation of 
                    a great South African legend, a monarch known as Shaka Zulu. Shaka died in 1828 after being murdered by his 
                    half-brothers, this has affected Andile and created many trust issues in his present life. Before his death, 
                    Shaka had lost his mother which caused a downward mental spiral. His actions during this time had changed him 
                    into what many viewed as a cruel tyrant, leading to his assassination. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Andile only became fully aware of his past life at the age of 10, a life his present life parents deemed 
                    a result of “over-imagination”. After being overwhelmed Andile took interest in yoga, meditation, gardening, 
                    and painting to help him deal with everything.

                <p> 
                    His hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action that changes the lives 
                    of many has contributed to his most recent success in launching a personal website that doubles as a blog. 
                    Through this website/blog he shares his past life experiences in mental health, current life experiences in 
                    the digital age and reflects on some of the most dominant moments in digital history that have not only 
                    changed how humans interact but how we view ourselves.
