                <p>
                    The world we live in has been heavily impacted by technology, with specific emphasize on digital technology. 
                    Digital technology has caused us to think about the safety and privacy surrounding our digital self. 
                    Where in the past surveillance was a term to best describe government officials only observing possible threats 
                    and criminals, it is now a common idea that we are all being monitored and the possibility of being a threat 
                    has expanded. Beyond government digital surveillance, our digital data and information is stored by ‘megaplatforms’ 
                    and often sold to businesses for their marketing strategies. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In chapter 7 of her book, Deborah Lupton expands on the topic of digital surveillance stating that we are living in 
                    a “post-panoptic world”. She defines a post-panoptic world as one whereby “Surveillance is a mode of authoritarian 
                    power, whereby those being monitored don’t have to give explicit consent and those monitoring don’t have to reflect 
                    transparency.” This is a concern, as it should be required that for anyone to have access to and use our digital 
                    information, our explicit consent should be provided.

                <p>
                    In South Africa the government introduced an act, Protection of Personal information Act 2013 (hereafter referred to as POPI). 
                    This act is yet to be officially put into action, however when it does, it is meant to protect individuals from harm by 
                    protecting their personal information (Michalsons 2019). A term that Deborah had touched on, 
                    introduced by Danah Boyd ‘Networked privacy’, caused me to question the adequacy of not only the POPI Act, but all other 
                    similar legislations in protecting user privacy. Networked privacy brings to light the fact that one may have their personal 
                    information shared even through other people, for example when a friend or family member posts about you and in a way shares 
                    your personal information. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the POPI act I have noted that it promotes the protection of user information with focus on entities accessing the 
                    information, directly from users, but not much provision has been made for information shared through 3rd parties or 
                    related to the user. Furthermore the act doesn’t address the importance of users having ownership and control over their 
                    digital data and information.

                <p> 
                    The idea of the digital self plays a vital role in the concepts of privacy and safety. As stated by Watson, 
                    “We are our data”. Our digital selves are an extension of us, especially because they are tied to personal 
                    information of who we really are. Just as in reality we have human rights, given the digital age, the rights 
                    should expand to also protect our digital selves adequately. As individuals we should be allowed to have ownership, 
                    access and control over our digital data, as well as power to choose who and how it may be used, factors that aren’t 
                    adequately present in the Protection Of Personal Information Act (of 2013).
