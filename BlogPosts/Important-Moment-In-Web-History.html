                    In 1993, the Mosaic web browser was developed by students at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) 
                    at the University of Illinois. Of all developing web browsers at the time Mosaic had competitive advantage based on the 
                    features it contained. At this point the popularity of the Mosaic web browser had peaked.

                <p>
                    However, due to conflicts with the University of Illinois the students, one of whom was Marc Andreessen, had to
                    begin a new venture which they named Netscape. They then launched the Netscape navigator 0.9, a web browser. 
                    In a short period of time, the Netscape navigator was able to defeat the mosaic browser in terms of usage share 
                    of browsers 
                </p>

                    It was not long after this that Bill gates saw opportunity in the development of web browsers. Microsoft windows was 
                    already popular at the time, however it did not come with a browser meaning that on Microsoft windows, you needed to 
                    buy(install) a web browser separately. It was then that Microsoft introduced Internet Explorer version one. 
                    Soon after the launch of version one Internet Explorer version 2, with major upgrades, was launched and challenged 
                    Netscape navigator. Over the years the companies began to rapidly compete in the upgrading of their browsers, a 
                    period that would be known as "The browser wars".

                    The browser wars saw the decline of Netscape. Netscape then open-sourced their code. This led to Mozilla Foundation 
                    creating a successor to their browser known as Mozilla Firefox. Many other browsers followed, such as The Opera web 
                    browser and eventually Google Chrome web browser.

                    Although not having arose in the best ways, I believe that the competition midst 'the browser wars' saw a rapid 
                    increase in the improvement of the quality and efficiency of browsers. This allowing us to enjoy the internet in 
                    the ways we do today. Had there been no competition and only monopoly, the development of browsers would have been 
                    slower and of less efficiency as compared to now. For this reason I choose ‘The browser wars’ as one of the most 
                    significant moments in web history.
