     <p>In their article <cite>‘Digital inequalities and why they matter’</cite>
        Laura Robinson et el establish that <cite>“digital inequality deserves a place 
        alongside more traditional forms of inequality in the twenty-ﬁrst century pantheon of inequalities.”</cite> 
        (Robinson et el 2015).  They argue that the relevance and importance of digital inequalities are relevant in 
        many areas of human social and personal aspects, throughout the 
      <cite> “life course, gender, race, and class, as well as health care, politics, economic activity, and social capital.”</cite>
         (Robinson et el 2015). For this blog post, I will be focusing on the digital inequalities specific to gender.</p>

    <p>Notably, in an increasingly digital society an <cite>“ individuals’ digital engagements and digital capital play key roles in a range 
    of outcomes, from academic performance to labour market success, to entrepreneurship, and health services uptake.”</cite> (Robinson et el 2015). 
    This emphasizes the importance of equality regarding access to and the use of digital technologies, as well as, the internet. 
    Robinson et el assert that <cite>“Those who function better in the digital realm and participate more fully in digitally mediated social 
        life enjoy advantages over their digitally disadvantaged counterparts”</cite> (Robinson et el 2015). 
        To give an illustration of this, one can refer to the current national pandemic and how it has impacted how business is conducted. 
        Many companies and institutions have resorted to digital means to ensure the continuation of business and academic calendars, as a result, 
        those who either lack the skill of using digital technologies or don’t have access to them, are placed at a disadvantage as compared to those who do. </p> 

    <p>Although there has been a decrease in the gap, between men and women, regarding access to digital technologies and the internet 
    (Robinson et el 2015). There is still a significant difference in the advantages and use of the internet presented to them. 
    Robinson et el, affirm that there is a difference in the frequency of use, the intensity of use, range of online activities, 
    and the likelihood of creating strong internet skills in women as compared to men. Furthermore, they have discovered that recent 
    evidence suggests that women are more likely to spend time on the internet for communication purposes and social support, reflecting 
    how online behaviour is often “an extension of broader social roles, interests, and expectations existent in society.” (Robinson et el 2015).</p>

    <p>Upon reflection, I found this statement to apply even to my chosen character for my site. Andile is a male who loves 
        to cook and has a blog. A blog, that he uses for communication and emotional support. Not to suggest that males don’t enjoy cooking or
         engaging in social support, however, based on the stereotypes that have been assigned to women, it can be argued that Andile is a 
         reflection of my interests as a female. More so, this caused me to reflect as to why I chose a male character as the owner/developer 
         of this blog? Is it possible that Robinson et el statement in that women are likely to underestimate their online skills and abilities 
         compared to men, applies to me?</p>
