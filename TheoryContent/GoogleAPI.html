    <h1>Why I chose Google Street View</h1>
   
    
    <time datetime=" 2020/06/29"> Posted Monday, 29 June</time>

    <p>Andile Nkosi is a blogger, foodie, and aspiring influencer situated in Johannesburg. He loves to travel around 
      Johannesburg finding new food to try and explore with. Furthermore, he loves sharing what he finds with his readers, 
      so they too can visit these areas and experience them too. Having google street view embedded into the blog post for 
      the top 5 restaurants allows readers to feel as if they are in the area physically. It gives them a realistic view of 
      how the restaurants look like and the atmosphere around each place. </p>
   
    <p>Google Street View is a compilation of panoramic photos that can be uploaded by businesses or customers. According to 
      Anne Karasarides (2020), customer interest in business and engagement is likely to double if there is an inclusion of 
      photos and virtual tours. Therefore, as an aspiring influencer Andile is able to encourage his website visitors to visit 
      the actual restaurant represented in the post. </p>
   
    <p>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, individuals were restricted in going to restaurants. As a result, to allow readers to 
      still feel like they are connected to the real world, it was vital that the website provide reflects and challenges the 
      surrounding that the readers cannot currently experience physically. Furthermore, as many of the restaurants are in locations 
      that aren’t easily visible if it is the first time that an individual visits the area, having the street view Google map 
      embedded in the site allows for users to have an idea as to what to look for when they do finally visit the area. 
      Through this, the street view has allowed for the physical and the digital world to combine.</p>
   
    <p>Besides creating a connection with the targeted audience, Google street view demonstrates quality in the website, as it 
      reflects that the character cares about providing the best experience to the readers. Virtual viewing and tours are 
      becoming increasingly ubiquitous. Over the years there has been an increase in platforms that provide similar experiences 
      as to Google street. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Google Earth</strong>  provides a satellite view imagery of Earth. <strong>HERE WeGo</strong> allows users to 
      explore their surrounding world in 3D. <strong>Apple Maps</strong> allows for interactive 3D views, Flyover and turn-by-turn 
      spoken directions.  Other alternatives also include, but are not limited to, Mapillary, Modest Maps, Yandex.Maps, Bing Maps, 
      and MapQuest. MapQuest has gone on to be one of Google maps’ top competitors in being the number one map site. </p>
    
    <p>Regardless of the many alternatives that present themselves, I chose to use Google street view based mainly on how easy it is 
      to access and familiarity. Many subscribers are likely to understand google maps (street view). As it often accompanies many 
      android phones, moreover, it is part of Google which is currently dominating the market share (Oberlo, 2020).  </p>
    
    <p> Furthermore, a recent report (McGee, 2008:1) states that Google maps is ranked number one in terms of features and usability. 
      To this end, readers and site visitors are likely to have increase ease in using Google street view based on familiarity </p>
    
    <p>Having the Google street view map embedded into the website establishes a professional, sophisticated, and user-friendly experience 
      to readers, which ties in with what the character aims to achieve on his personal website. It also allows users to feel as though 
      they have, furthermore, been invited into his world. </p>
