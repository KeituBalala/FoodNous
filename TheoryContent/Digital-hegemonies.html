        <h1>Reflection: Digital hegemonies (The localness of search engine)</h1>

         <time datetime=" 2020/05/24">Posted Sunday, 24 May</time>

        <p>In this blog post, I will be reflecting on the article by Andrea Ballatore, Mark Graham, and 
      Shilad Sen about digital hegemonies. In their article Ballatore, Graham and Sen aim to investigate the 
      localness of content that google search engines generate and show to individuals from various locations. 
      They aim to answers questions such as to what degree is a particular city’s information locally produced, 
        as well as, which countries produce their representation and which are represented by others.</p>

        <p>Towards understanding the importance of local digital representation Ballatore et al begins by stating that 
    <cite>“global mediators such as Google and Bing play a crucial role in determining which Web sites, news, 
    blogs, videos, and photographs become visible to whom.”</cite> (Ballatore et al 2017). 
    In this, Ballatore et al reflect how the information and knowledge we are exposed to is controlled by 
    the search engines we use. As a result, the search engine we use and the information that they provide us, 
         largely impact how we engage and learn online, as well as how we navigate our surroundings.</p>

        <p>Ballatore et al emphasize how the information provided by search engines about the areas we are in impact us, 
      by asserting that “digital representations of physical places play an increasingly important societal and cultural role” 
      (Ballatore et al 2017). In other words, how we experience the local places we wish to go to or are currently in, is 
      greatly influenced by how they are represented online. That being said, it is of importance that the information is 
      contributed by sources who have experienced these areas and can provide a detailed and authentic description of the 
        environment, further emphasizing the importance of locally produced content. </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, not all cities or countries have the opportunity to contribute to how they are represented. 
      This is because not all have access to the necessary resources. Ballatore et al assert that “geographic region, 
      strength of scholarly publishing, Internet infrastructure, and language barriers all play important roles in 
      shaping the geography of Google Search results.” (Ballatore et al 2017). To that end, “wealthy and well-connected “ 
      (Ballatore et al 2017) countries are more likely to have locally produced representation and content, furthermore 
      being able to produce content about other countries and cities that are at a disadvantage. This then creates what 
        Ballatore et al reflect as digital hegemonies. </p>

        <p>In South Africa, Stats SA reports that 59,3% of South African has access to the internet somehow, however, 
      only 2% of rural households are well connected(TheSpaceStation 2018). This is likely to reflect that majority 
      of the information and content about rural areas is produced by those in urban areas, which causes one to question 
        the accuracy in how these areas are represented.</p>
