                    The world we live in has been heavily impacted by technology, with a specific emphasis on digital technology. 
                    Digital technology has caused us to think about the safety and privacy surrounding our digital self. Where in 
                    the past surveillance was a term to best describe government officials only observing possible threats and 
                    criminals, it is now a common idea that we are all being monitored and the possibility of being a threat has 
                    expanded. Beyond government digital surveillance, our digital data and information is stored by ‘mega-platforms’ 
                    and often sold to businesses for their marketing strategies. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In chapter 7 of her book, Deborah Lupton expands on the topic of digital surveillance stating that we are living 
                    in a “post-panoptic world”. She defines a post-panoptic world as one whereby “Surveillance is a mode of 
                    authoritarian power, whereby those being monitored don’t have to give explicit consent and those monitoring don’t 
                    have to reflect transparency.” This is a concern, as it should be required for anyone to have access to and use 
                    our digital information, our explicit consent should be provided.

                <p>
                    In South Africa, the government introduced an act, Protection of Personal Information Act 2013 
                    (hereafter referred to as POPI). This act is yet to be officially put into action, however, when it does, 
                    it is meant to protect individuals from harm by protecting their personal information (Michalsons 2019). 
                    A term that Deborah had touched on, introduced by Danah Boyd ‘Networked privacy’, caused me to question 
                    the adequacy of not only the POPI Act but all other similar legislation in protecting user privacy. 
                    Networked privacy brings to light the fact that one may have their personal information shared even 
                    through other people, for example when a friend or family member posts about you and in a way share your 
                    personal information. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the POPI act, I have noted that it promotes the protection of user information with a focus on entities 
                    accessing the information, directly from users, but not much provision has been made for information shared 
                    through 3rd parties or related to the user. Furthermore, the act doesn’t address the importance of users 
                    having ownership and control over their digital data and information. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    The idea of the digital self plays a vital role in the concepts of privacy and safety. As stated by Watson, 
                    “We are our data”. Our digital selves are an extension of us, especially because they are tied to personal 
                    information of who we really are. Just as in reality we have human rights, given the digital age, the rights 
                    should expand to also protect our digital selves adequately. As individuals, we should be allowed to have ownership, 
                    access, and control over our digital data, as well as the power to choose who and how it may be used, factors 
                    that aren’t adequately present in the Protection Of Personal Information Act (of 2013).
