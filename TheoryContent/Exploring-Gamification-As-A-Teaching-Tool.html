                    Technological innovations have allowed for increased integration of online learning. 
                    Student are increasingly depending on digital technologies to complete various tasks, 
                    which has influenced the in which students learn. As a result, many institutions aim to incorporate 
                    digital means to achieve teaching objectives.

                <p>
                    Through making use of interactive media, various institutions have introduced online courses into their curriculum. Some of the common interactive tools used for online learning include eBooks, recorded lectures, quizzes, discussion forums, and live Q&A sessions. One other interactive media that has recently been gaining more attention in being a tool for online education is gamification.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Oxford dictionary defines gamification as<q>the application of typical elements of game playing (e.g. point scoring, competition with others and rules of play) to other areas of activity</q>. One of the main goals for gamification in online learning is to encourage students to be more engaged with their learning experiences, which is achieved through students feeling motivated to participate

                <p> 
                    Gamification scholar Rui Pedro Lopes, in his article titled ‘Gamification as a learning tool’, advances that the more motivated a student is in learning something, the more time and effort they will spend learning. Furthermore, they are likely to feel better about what they learn and use it throughout life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through its ability to influence motivation in learners and create a fun learning environment gamification presents the online education system with many advantages, such as:
                </p>

                <h2>Increased learner engagement</h2>
                <p>Gamification in eLearning allows for improved attention from learners allowing for increased engagement. When learners feel positive towards their learning process and have some form of reward to look forward too, they are encouraged to become active participants. This results in them being able to absorb the information.</p>

                <h2>It makes eLearning fun and interactive</h2>
                <p>It is important that learners be excited about what they are learning. Gamification in online educations makes learning not only informative but fun and exciting too. It also creates an interactive element in the learning experience. This allows for the feeling of immersion, further contributing to learner’s experience</p>

                <h2>Improves knowledge absorption and retention</h2>
                <p>Through the blending of endorphins, released when participating in gamification, and awareness of real-world advantages, gamification can improve knowledge absorption and retention. </p>

                <h2>It gives learners the opportunity to see real-world applications</h2>
                <p>Learners are able to get first-hand experience in how their choices and actions in the game apply to the real world. Furthermore allowing them to see how those choices result in consequences or rewards. </p>

                <h2>Enhances the overall learning experience for all age groups</h2>
                <p>Through the design of the learning experience and different levels that present themselves in games. Gamification can be integrated and implemented at all learning levels. </p>

                <p>
                    Gamification may continue to become one of the sort after tools for improving online education. 
                    The success, however, of Gamification as a teaching tool in online education, according to Christopher Devers, 
                    associate professor at Indiana Wesleyan University whose research focuses on technology and ways it could promote learning, 
                    is to ensure that students aren’t just meeting performance goals without actually mastering the subject matter and that we 
                    ensure educators know how and when to use gamification to allow an opportunity for students to reflect on topics to avoid 
                    gamification possibly becoming a distraction.
