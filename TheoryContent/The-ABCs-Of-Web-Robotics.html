                    Web robotics are automated programs and software applications that complete tasks on the internet. 
                    Web robotics are also known as web crawlers, spiders, bots, and wanderers. 
                    They mainly perform repetitive tasks such as indexing web content and scanning email addresses amongst a few.

                    There are two main types of web bot, being the good and the bad. The legitimate bots are mainly the web spiders (Crawlers) and the data aggregator bot. 
                    The web spiders, deployed by search engines, keep the search engine’s index up to date with relevant and timeous information about sites being visited. 
                    Web developers and site owners usually welcome these types of bots because they assist in ensuring that their sites appear in search engine results, 
                    exposing them to potential users and site visitors. The data aggregator bot similar to the web spiders performs the task of updating certain directories 
                    or various content listing with information about visited sites. Other legitimate bots include Trading and Media Web robots.

                    The bad web bots are those bots used for malicious purposes with effects that range between being mildly harmful and possibly catastrophic. 
                    The main types of malicious bots include spam, hacker, and botnets download web robots. Malicious bots are often as a result of cyber-attacks. 
                    Cyber-attacks by malicious bots could result in:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Card Fraud (Credit and Gift)</li>
                        <li>Credential Attacks b </li>
                        <li>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</li>
                        <li>Scraping and Data Theft (Prices, Content, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Spam</li>
                        <li>Vulnerability Scans</li>
                        <li>Advertising abuse (Click fraud).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    Malicious web bots pose many disadvantages and threats to key business processes as well as user security and experience. 
                    To ensure the continued advantage of web robotics, it is becoming an increasing subject of urgency to further find ways to 
                    combat and respond to malicious bots so that users may obtain guaranteed satisfaction from using and engaging on the web. 
                    Despite the disadvantages, bots have contributed to increased productivity and accuracy of web search engines, resulting in 
                    improved user experience. As a result, web robotics continue to be of importance as they can perform automated tasks at rates 
                    faster than humans, guaranteeing efficiency.
