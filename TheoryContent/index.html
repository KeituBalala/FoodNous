                  Over the years various forms of media have emerged as a result of technological advancements. 
                  The concept of interactivity has been used to define and identify many of these new forms of media.

                  The browser wars saw the decline of Netscape. Netscape then open-sourced their code. This led to Mozilla Foundation creating 
                  a successor to their browser known as Mozilla Firefox. Many other browsers followed, such as The Opera web browser and 
                  eventually Google Chrome web browser.
