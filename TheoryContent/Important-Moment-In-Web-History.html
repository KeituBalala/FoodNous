                    In 1993, the Mosaic web browser was developed by students at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) 
                    at the University of Illinois. Of all developing web browsers at the time Mosaic had a competitive advantage based on 
                    the features it contained. At this point, the popularity of the Mosaic web browser had peaked.   
            </p>

                <img src = "../Images/IMIWH Intext Image 1.png" 
    alt = "Image Of Mosaic"/>

            <p>
                    However, due to conflicts with the University of Illinois the students, one of whom was Marc Andreessen, 
                    had to begin a new venture named Netscape. They then launched the Netscape navigator 0.9, a web browser. 
                    In a short period, the Netscape navigator was able to defeat the mosaic browser in terms of usage share of browsers.  
            </p>

            <p>
                    It was not long after this that Bill Gates saw an opportunity in the development of web browsers. 
                    Microsoft was already popular at the time, however, it did not come with a browser meaning that on Microsoft Windows, 
                    you needed to buy(install) a web browser separately. It was then that Microsoft introduced Internet Explorer version one. 
                    Soon after the launch of version one Internet Explorer version 2, with major upgrades, was launched and challenged 
                    Netscape navigator. Over the years the companies began to rapidly compete in the upgrading of their browsers, a period 
                    that would be known as "The browser wars". 
            </p>

                <img src = "../Images/IMIWH Intext Image 2.png" 
    alt = "Image of Netcape"/>

            <p> 
                    The browser wars saw the decline of Netscape. Netscape then open-sourced their code. This led to Mozilla Foundation creating 
                    a successor to their browser known as Mozilla Firefox. Many other browsers followed, such as The Opera web browser and 
                    eventually Google Chrome web browser.
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                    Although not having arisen in the best ways, I believe that the competition midst 'the browser wars' saw a rapid increase in 
                    the improvement of the quality and efficiency of browsers. This allowing us to enjoy the internet in the ways we do today. 
                    Had there been no competition and only monopoly, the development of browsers would have been slower and less efficient as 
                    compared to now. For this reason, I choose ‘The browser wars’ as one of the most significant moments in web history.
