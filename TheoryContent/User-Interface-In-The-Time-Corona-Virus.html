                    User interface refers to the tool or platform with which the user interacts, this could be the actual website, 
                    an application or hardware. The purpose of the interface is to allow effective control or influence of the platform 
                    from the human end, while the platform simultaneously provides relevant feedback to the user. An adequately designed 
                    user interface is important in helping websites and applications retain viewers.  
                    The way the user interface of a platform has been designed and structured is a major contribution to how the user 
                    experiences that platform. For this blog post, I will focus on how users experience biometric user interfaces in the 
                    time of Coronavirus

                    <q>We now live in a digital society</q> (Lupton 2015), this can be seen through digital technologies becoming ubiquitous. 
                    Furthermore, digital technologies have offered themselves as a tool to respond to various security risks.  
                    Biometrics authentication is used in many industries as a form of identification and access control.
                    The two main groups of biometrics are identified as either having physiological characteristics or behavioural 
                    characteristics. The most common behavioural biometric is voice recognition, whereas the most common physiological 
                    biometric is the fingerprint scanner. Of the two, the fingerprint scanner is the most used. However, 
                    the spread of the coronavirus has affected how users experience this interface
                </p>

                <p>
                    Corona Virus has been discovered to not only transfer directly from one person to another but also through objects 
                    and surfaces around the person. Other people can then possibly catch the virus by touching those objects or surfaces, 
                    then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. The fear of contracting the virus has negatively impacted user experience 
                    with biometrics such as the fingerprint scanner
                </p>

                    In his article <site>Alternative approaches to interface technology<site> Steve Gibson states that 
                    <q>Alternative interfaces can be generally described as computer input systems that allow the user 
                    or users to connect to a digital environment without the use of conventional means.</q> 
                    Alternative biometric interfaces could be implemented through the use of face, iris, and voice recognition. 
                    In this time of the coronavirus, it is possible to see how these alternative methods should be explored and 
                    possibly implemented for biometrics systems to continue achieving their objectives while ensuring positive user experience.
