     <p><cite>“Profiles offer a strong sense of individualism since the aggregate presentation of so much information 
         linked to a single person help to define that person” </cite>(Graham and Dutton 2014)</p>

     <p>Upon graduating high school, I was exposed to a much larger world of content sharing. 
         Shortly after starting my university career, I discovered that I could create and launch my own online blogsite. 
         Initially, I felt so excited as I  had discovered a broader platform to express my individuality. 
         But when it came down to it, I never prepared myself for the actual work and preparations that came with having a blog, 
         and thus having to represent yourself online. Essentially I thought you simply just write what you wish to share with the 
         world and upload it. However, I discovered that there is more to it than that.</p>

     <p>In their article Graham and Dutton ask a series of questions that prompt one to reflect on the medias they use, for 
         online communication, and how these medias affect the way in which the represent themselves and engage with others. 
         Reflecting on my journey as a blogger, I aim to answer these questions to further establish and reflect on how I 
         represented myself online.</p>

     <h2>What does my blog and Instagram, as a tool to promote it, mean to my sense of self?</h2>

        <p>Over the years, I began to see my blog and my Instagram account as extensions of myself. 
        The content that I shared often reflected the ideas and thoughts that I would have when alone. 
        My beliefs and values largely impacted the information I would share with the world and my comments on various topics. 
        Although, currently having an increasingly well-defined sense of what and how I want to represent myself online, 
        and having a stable understanding of who I am as inspiration for my sense of self. Initially, when joining social 
        networks as a content creator I found myself consistently confused as to how to define myself on these platforms. 
        This resulted me in constantly being faced with overwhelming fear and anxiety. The feelings of fear and anxiety were 
        as a result of pressure I had placed on myself to make every single blog and Instagram post perfect. 
        I had set unrealistic standards for myself based off of what I saw other bloggers posting and sharing.</p>

        <p>>My blog and Instagram account began to greatly impact my sense of self. The goal for all my posts became 
        more about making everything sound relevant and inspiring to the reader, but the larger more vulnerable 
        part of me was strategically hidden. I then went on a journey I like to refer to as “Self-auditing”, 
        whereby I redefined myself based on who I truly am and aspired to be. In this, I was able to ensure, 
        that my blog and Instagram remain an extension of me and not the defining factors.</p>
  
     <p><cite>“Strictly speaking, profiles are not people but selective representations of people.”</cite> (Graham and Dutton 2014) </p>

     <h2>What does having a blog mean for the social contexts that help me define myself and learn about the others I consider important</h2>

     <p>In blogging, I discovered that there are various legalities that I have to take into consideration if I wish to blog and engage 
     with other people legally. For example; in my blog I do ask and encourage people to subscribe to email updates. This means that I will be 
     collecting a variety of personal data, such as their names and email addresses. With collecting personal data comes the responsibility of 
     adhering to the relevant laws pertaining to the security and protection of that data. When people share their personal information with me, 
     as a website owner I acquire the responsibility of having to protect and secure that information. There are, thus, various obligations that 
    I was exposed to, to ensure that I limit the legal liability for myself and the website. It was crucial that I learned about and created 
    privacy policies, terms and conditions as well as disclaimer and cookie policies, so that I could engage with people in a manner that ensures 
    their information is protected, as well as my own.</p>
