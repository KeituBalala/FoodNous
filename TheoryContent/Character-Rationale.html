                    Andile Thomas Nkosi is a 25-year old, African male. He is a registered clinical psychologist with a Masters in 
                    Psychology. He is fuelled by his passion for understanding the nuances of mental health, especially in the digital 
                    age. He considers himself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on his academic foundations in psychology and 
                    sociology and stays in tune with the latest digital technologies through continued coursework and professional 
                    development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Andile was born in Kimberley, Northern Cape, and is currently residing in Marshalltown, Johannesburg in a 2 
                    bedroom apartment. With average height and build, brown eyes, and dark brown hair, Andile is empathetic and 
                    smart as well as slightly hypersensitive. He loves fashion and food and considers himself the ultimate gentleman. 
                    His most distinguishing feature is that he has a great smile. His favourite dress code is smart casual, paired 
                    with his favourite watch. He has a demanding presence and walks with confidence and power

                <p>
                    What provoked the idea of Andile as a character was during my research of internet cultures I had discovered an 
                    increase in the number and importance of influencers in today's cyberculture. The fact that anyone with a strong 
                    opinion about various brands and products could influence a large group of people just through the products they 
                    use and purchased sparked interest in me to create a character who ultimately becomes an influencer to better 
                    understand what sparked this trend and why it is of so much importance
                </p>

                <p>
                    Therefore, through Andile being a food blogger have the opportunity to reflect on how much the web has given 
                    ordinary people means to create and share their content with people from all over the world. Furthermore, 
                    how this has given rise to the cyberculture of influencers,
