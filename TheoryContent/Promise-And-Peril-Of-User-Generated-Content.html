                <p>
                    Web 2.0, also referred to as the social web, saw an increase in web user prosumption. 
                    The term prosumption is to define an individual who both produces and consumes on a particular platform. 
                    During this phase of web history, users of digital technology were able to interact and collaborate with 
                    each other through social media as creators, resulting in user-generated content.
                </p>

                <p>
                    User-generated content includes pictures, videos, text, audio and any other form of media that has been 
                    posted online by a user. The continued advancements in digital technology have allowed for increased 
                    accessibility and distribution, thus allowing for an easy platform to create and dispense user-generated content 
                    (hereafter referred to as UGC). 
                </p>

                <img src = "../Images/UGC Intext Image .jpg" 
    alt = "Cartoon Depicting User-Generated Content"/>

                <p>
                    UGC is shared for various purposes, such as entertainment, news, marketing, research, awareness, 
                    and problem-solving. A continuous growth of individuals are taking advantage of the interactive opportunities 
                    in creating independent content, thus resulting in the democratization of content creation. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As digital technologies allow for speed in accessing the masses, there are many opportunities in the continued distribution and recirculation of UGC that present themselves. These opportunities include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users being able to bring awareness to issues within their communities and countries, such as #AmINext, #BlackLivesMatter and #FeesMustFall, which could bring about positive change on a large scale.</li>
                        <li>Users are able to provide key eyewitness content and information that may otherwise have been inaccessible</li>
                        <li>Access to reviews. With the continued use of e-commerce and online business dealings, users are able to access online reviews from other individuals to better understand a brand or product that they can no longer physically check before engaging with or purchasing it.</li>
                        <li>Users are able to share knowledge and form collective intelligence. Social groups such as fandoms have allowed for many to feel as though they are a part of a community especially in what can often be a divisive and disconnected world. This also allows users to gain perspectives from individuals that they wouldn't otherwise be able to engage with.</li>
                        <li>UGC also allows for easy marketing and reach for companies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

               <img src = "../Images/UGC Intext Image 2.png" 
    alt = "Cartoon Illustration Of Digital Interactions"/> 

                <p> 
                    Although there being many benefits in UGC there are various disadvantages that present themselves. Such as;
                    <ul>
                        <li>Issues concerning privacy. In South Africa, the government introduced an act, Protection of Personal Information Act of 2013 (which I will review in the Review On Protection Of Personal Information Act blog post.) as an attempt to deal with this concern.</li>
                        <li>Continued breach of copyright law, as UGC is often based on copyrighted material.</li>
                        <li>Vigilantism without firm evidence.</li>
                        <li>Easy spread of fake news and false information.</li>
                        <li>Social media shamming and social discriminations.</li>
                    </ul> 
                </p>

                <p>
                    User-generated content brings various opportunities to the digital society, regardless, there are many 
                    critical disadvantages that must be considered.
