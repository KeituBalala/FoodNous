                    Over the years various forms of media have emerged as a result of technological advancements. 
                    The concept of interactivity has been used to define and identify many of these new forms of media. 
                    Although emphasis has been placed on the importance of interactivity, there is still much confusion and 
                    debate surrounding what makes something interactive.

                <p>
                    The Oxford dictionary defines interactivity as <q>the process of two people or things working together and 
                    influencing each other</q> further establishing that <q>the ability of a computer to respond to a user's input</q> 
                    reflects interactivity. Although establishing the bases of interactivity, this definition doesn’t fully 
                    enable the understanding of what makes something interactive. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Upon analysing various scholars’ definition of interactivity, scholars’ such as Aaron Smuts, Lev Manovich, 
                    Espen Aarseth, and Gonzalo Frasca, the Interactive Media group reached an understanding that the main points 
                    in what makes something interactive is that	
                    <ul>
                        <li>it is responsive</li>
                        <li>does not respond in a completely random fashion</li>
                        <li>requires nontrivial effort.</li>
                        <li>which, in some way, modify the shape of the text itself.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Web interactivity is one of the top forms of interactive media used, it refers to the interactive features that 
                    are embedded on websites. Web interactivity evolves with the continued introduction of new developments of website 
                    interfaces. Some of the web interactive features include hyperlinks, feedback, and multimedia displays. 
                    Other forms of interactive media include social networking sites, video games, mobile applications, and virtual reality.

                    Interactive media provides many opportunities for user engagement and benefits. One of the increasingly notable ways 
                    that users are expected to benefit from interactive media is through its effects on learning. 
                    Interactive media contributes to the four development dimensions in which young children learn. 
                    The dimensions being social and emotional, language development, cognitive and general knowledge, and approach toward learning. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Interactive media has contributed to the success of online learning. 
                    In my blog post <a href="../TheoryContent/Exploring-Gamification-As-A-Teaching-Tool.html"><em>Exploring gamification as a teaching tool in online education</em></a>, 
                    I explore interactive video games as a tool for online learning.
