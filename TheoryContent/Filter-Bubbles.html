     <h1>Bonus Blog: Reflection of my self-representation as a blogger</h1>
    
    <time datetime=" 2020/29/10"> Posted Monday, 29 June</time>

    <p>In this blog post I will be reflecting on Eli Pariser’s Ted Talk on Filter Bubbles. This blog post was inspired by 
      a tweet from Mar Faddoul, whereby he addresses the face-based filter bubbles produced on TikTok. I aim to define what 
      a filter bubble is, address and reflect on the key arguments made by Pariser </p>
    
    <p>The Oxford dictionary defines a filter bubble as <cite>“a situation in which an Internet user encounters only information 
      and opinions that conform to and reinforce their own beliefs, caused by algorithms that personalize an individual’s 
      online experience.”</cite> (Oxford 2020).  In his Ted Talk, Pariser reflects on a filter bubble as <cite> 
        “your own personal, unique universe of information that you live in online.”</cite>(Parisers, 2013). 
        In other words, a filter bubble is a situation in which you are exposed to information according to an 
        algorithmic process, based on your online behaviour and patterns. </p>
    
    <p>Although online behaviour and patterns are the main source of data to be used in the algorithmic process, 
      Pariser highlight that often our offline behaviours are also monitored to collect data and more information 
      for setting filters. Pariser states that there are 57 signals used by Google, including the kind of computer 
      you use, to the browser you access, and where you are seated. Algorithmic filtering often happens without users 
      being aware of it, this is something that Pariser (2013)  refers to as the <cite> “invisible algorithmic editing of the web.”</cite> </p>
    
    <p>Many scholars have begun highlighting the disadvantages in the filter bubble. Besides the concern regarding the 
      ethical considerations of the internet, filter bubbles are formed based on who you are as an individual, as well 
      as, what you do. However, what makes up the filter bubble is not decided by the individual in the bubble, therefore, 
      one cant sees what was left out of the bubble.  Users have no say in what is being filtered. This results in the internet 
      providing information based on what algorithms think we want, rather than showing the information we need. </p>
    
    <p>The main concern with having algorithmic gatekeepers to the information that is presented to us is that these gatekeepers 
      have no sense of <cite> “civic responsibility”</cite>. People receiving information based on who they are and what they do 
      breeds opportunity for digital inequalities. As there may be information that is vital to all, but many won’t receive it 
      because of it being decided through algorithms that it isn’t suitable or relevant to the individual. </p>
    
    <p>Pariser advances that to curb and avoid many of the disadvantages of the filter bubble, it is of essence that the algorithms 
      employed to process the filters, encoded in them transparency, to better establish what rule is used to determine the 
      information that forms part of a bubble. Furthermore, increased control to individuals to determine for themselves what 
      gets through and what doesn’t.  This helps in achieving the internet that allows us to connect with new people, ideas, 
      and perspectives. </p>
