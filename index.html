          <h3>Everything Food Psychiatry</h3>
          <p style="color:#7d8b11;">Have you ever realised how much happier you are after enjoying a nice cold tub of ice cream after a 
            long and brutal day at work? Or when you cant sleep at night and the first thing you think of is going 
            to the fridge. Better yet, when you find yourself stuck in a boring situation and your mind wonders off 
            to what you’ll be eating for lunch or dinner...</p>

          <h3>Reflection: Digital inequalities and why they matter</h3>
          <p style="color:#7d8b11;">Notably, in an increasingly digital society an <cite>“ individuals’ digital engagements and digital capital play key roles in a range 
            of outcomes, from academic performance to labour market success, to entrepreneurship, and health services uptake.”</cite> (Robinson et el 2015). 
            This emphasizes the importance of equality regarding access to and the use of digital technologies, as well as, the internet. 
            Robinson et el assert that <cite>“Those who function better in the digital realm and participate more fully in digitally mediated social 
                life enjoy advantages over their digitally disadvantaged counterparts”</cite> (Robinson et el 2015).</p>

          <h3>Reflection: Digital hegemonies (The localness of search engine)</h3>
          <p style="color:#7d8b11;">Towards understanding the importance of local digital representation Ballatore et al begins by stating that 
            <cite>“global mediators such as Google and Bing play a crucial role in determining which Web sites, news, 
            blogs, videos, and photographs become visible to whom.”</cite> (Ballatore et al 2017). 
            In this, Ballatore et al reflect how the information and knowledge we are exposed to is controlled by 
            the search engines we use. As a result, the search engine we use and the information that they provide us, 
            largely impact how we engage and learn online, as well as how we navigate our surroundings.</p>

          <h3>Bonus Blog: Reflection of my self-representation as a blogger</h3>
          <p style="color:#7d8b11;">My blog and Instagram account began to greatly impact my sense of self. The goal for all my posts became 
            more about making everything sound relevant and inspiring to the reader, but the larger more vulnerable 
            part of me was strategically hidden. I then went on a journey I like to refer to as “Self-auditing”, 
            whereby I redefined myself based on who I truly am and aspired to be. In this, I was able to ensure, 
            that my blog and Instagram remain an extension of me and not the defining factors.</p>
