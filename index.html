        <h2>The One Thing Top Browsers Have In Common</h2>
    </header>
        <p><q>A browser is a piece of software that serves as a user’s window and access point 
            to the World Wide Web.</q>(TeamsAsia, 2019). The importance of web browsers lies in 
            users being able access and view multiple websites. Before browsers, users had to 
            install multiple applications to be able to access various content, apps, chats and 
            functions. Web browsers allow provide users with and opportunity to enjoy smooth and seamless user experience.

        <h2>The ABCs Of Web Robotics</h2>
    </header>
        <p> Web robotics are automated programs and software applications that complete tasks on the internet. 
            Web robotics are also known as web crawlers, spiders, bots, and wanderers. 
            They mainly perform repetitive tasks such as indexing web content and scanning email addresses amongst a few.

        <h2>Character Rationale</h2>
    </header>
        <p>What provoked the idea of Andile as a character was during my research of internet cultures I had discovered an 
            increase in the number and importance of influencers in today's cyberculture. 
            The fact that anyone with a strong opinion about various brands and products could influence a large group of 
            people just through the products they use and purchased sparked interest in me to create a character who 
            ultimately becomes an influencer to better understand what sparked this trend and why it is of so much importance
