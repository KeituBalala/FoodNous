<h1>Hello World Welcome To My Site</h1>

<p> This is a class example so that I may see whether or not this works the way that it is supposed to. 
    This the place where my <em>character introduction paragraph</em> will be placed. I will explain 
    <strong>Who he is</strong> and <strong>his background story,</strong> in the first person</p>

<p> In 1993, the Mosaic web browser was developed by students at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. Of all developing web broswers at the time Mosaic had competitive advantage based on the features it contained. At this point the popularity of the Mosaic web browser had peaked. 
    However due to conflicts with the University of Illinois the students, one of whom was Marc Andreessen, that developed the broswer had to begin a new venture which they named Netscape and launched the Netscape navigator 0.9, a web browser. In a short period of time, the Netscape navigator was able to defeat the mosaic browser in terms of usage share of browsers. 
    It was not long after this that Bill gates saw opportunity in the development of we browsers. Microsoft windows was already popular at the time, however it did not come with a browser meaning that on Microsoft windows, you need to buy(install) a web browser separately. It was then that Microsoft introduced Internet Explorer version one. Soon after the launch of version one Internet Explorer version 2 with major upgrades was launched, challenging Netscape navigator. Over the years the companies began to rapidly compete in the upragding of their browsers, a period that would be known as "The browser wars". 
    The broswer wars saw the decline of Netscape. Netscape then open-sourced their code and later saw Mozilla Foundation creating a successor to their browser known as Mozilla Firefox. Many other broswers followed, such as The Opera web browser and eventually Google Chrome web browser.
    Although not having began in the best ways, the competition midst 'the broswer wars' saw a rapid increase in the improvement of the quality and efffeciency of broswers. This allowing us to enjoy the internet the way would today. Had there been no competition and only monopoly, the development of browsers would have been slower and of less effeciency as compared to now.
