        <h2>Character Rationale</h2>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>What provoked the idea of Andile as a character was during my research of internet cultures I had discovered an 
            increase in the number and importance of influencers in today's cyberculture. 
            The fact that anyone with a strong opinion about various brands and products could influence a large group of 
            people just through the products they use and purchased sparked interest in me to create a character who 
            ultimately becomes an influencer to better understand what sparked this trend and why it is of so much importance
