                <p>Hi there! </p>
                              <p>
                                  <strong>Welcome to Food Nous</strong>
                              </p>
              
                              <p>
                                  My name is Andile Thomas Nkosi. I am a 25-year-old registered clinical psychologist currently 
                                  contributing to the research in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry. Yes, that’s right! 
                                  Food does have a psychological impact on us.
                              </p>
              
                              <p>
                                  My journey in psychology began at the age of 15 after I was officially diagnosed with severe depression. 
                                  With the assistance of my parents, I sort out ways to improve my mental health. For years I studied the 
                                  psyche and went on to try various forms of therapy, one of which was electroconvulsive therapy. 
                                  This is whereby patients are electrically induced with seizures to relief mental disorders…
                              </p>
              
                              <p> 
                                  …Hectic.
                              </p>
              
                              <p>
                                  As scary as this sounds, over the years, technological advancements have contributed to an increase in the 
                                  number of successful treatments… then there was mine. Upon completing my treatment, although no longer having 
                                  signs of depression, it was discovered that I had suffered partial memory loss. I could remember who I was, my 
                                  family and where I come from, but certain personal experiences and general memories, I could not recall.  
                              </p>
              
                              <p>
                                  I then went on to dedicate even more of my time studying the human mind, finding ways to improve its health and memory retention. It was then that I discovered the impact of various foods on improving the overall mental state. As I experienced an improvement in my memory and overall state of mind, I saw an opportunity to combine my love for food and my passion for psychology. 
                              </p>
              
                              <p>
                                  It was then that I decided to start a mental health-focused food blog. A blog, through which, I aim to inspire a healthy mind and life, for other people, though undeniably delicious recipes

                              <p>
                                  I always say GOOD FOOD IS A GOOD MOOD. Join the family to binge on good food and content.
