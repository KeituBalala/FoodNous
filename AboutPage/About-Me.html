                    Hi there! My name is Andile Thomas Nkosi. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Welcome to my personal website and blog, Samsara!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I chose to name my website Samsara as it is more than a reflection of my life. 
                    As per the Oxford Dictionary Samsara is defined as “the cycle of death and rebirth to which life in the material world is bound.” 
                    This meaning was more than profound for me as I discovered at the age of 10 that I am the reincarnation of a well-known monarch, Shaka Zulu. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I went to bed that night not knowing that by morning my life will be completely changed. 
                    In a dream that felt like the world’s longest infomercial, I had relived every single moment of my past life. 
                    Re-experiencing every memory, in detail, as though I was there again. 
                    For many years my parents never believed that it was real, they just assumed that I had an overactive imagination. 
                    Over the years I fell in love with understanding the human mind, so I studied psychology and some sociology. 
                    But what began as an interest easily became my passion. 
                    Dealing with the traumas from my past life and adjusting to my newly defined one, 
                    I decided to launch a personal website in which I share and post about my experiences, 
                    but mainly I hope to help those with mental health issues, especially in the digital age.

                <p> 
                    There is already so much we deal with without the added pressure that comes with the use of digital technology. 
                    I hope that through my posts, readers are able to learn about our digital society; important factors, how its shapes us, 
                    and how it changes the why we think and engage with each other.
