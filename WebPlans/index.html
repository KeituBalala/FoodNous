        <h2>Website Style Guide</h2>
    </header>
        <img src = "Webstyle Design.png"
        alt = "Image showing website logo, colour palette, fonts and inspiration sites." width="400px" height= "500px"/>

    <p> This is the style guide to the website. The colours were chosen to reflect simplicity and sophistication which 
        are in line with the character's personality. As my character is a psychology colours for the site were chosen 
        based on colour psychology. The main colour is blue which is said to reflect serenity, tranquility, and calmness.

        <img src = "Wireframes Overview.png"
        alt = "All 4 Wireframes" width="400px" height= "500px" />

    <p> These are the old wireframes based on initial plans for the website.</p>

        <h2>Homepage Wireframe</h2>
    </header>
 
        <img src = "Homepage Wireframe.png"
        alt = "Image Of Annotated Homepage Wireframe" width="400px" height= "500px" />

    <p> The annotated home page wireframe has not changed much as compared to the original. 
        The main adjustment for the wireframe is that a search bar has been installed to allow
        site visitors to search the website for improved user experience.

        <h2>AboutPage Wireframe</h2>

        <img src = "AboutPage Wireframe.png"
        alt = "Image Of Annotated AboutPage Wireframe" width="400px" height= "500px" />
    
        <p> The annotated About page wireframe has been adjusted to include a footer so 
            that the user may access the necessary information about the legalities of the site 
            even when they are on this page. Furthermore, the search bar has also
            been included for improved user experience.

        <p> To ensure further quality user experience I aim to turn the website into a 
            responsive website that allows all content to adjust and fit properly on all screen sizes.</p>
